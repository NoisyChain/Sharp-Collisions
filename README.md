# Sharp-Collisions
Deterministic collision system written in C#

**Features:**
- 2D collisions (3D coming eventually)
- Discrete collision detection
- Deterministic behavior using fixed point math
- Broad Phase/Narrow Phase
- AABB collisions
- Sphere/Capsule collisions using distance checks
- Polygon collisions using GJK-EPA algorithms
- Collision layers / Ignore collisions
- Triggers
- Rotation support
- Collider offset
- Collision flags
- Collision events
- Collision manifolds (return contact normal, depth and point)
- A basic character controller

Sharp Collisions is in preview state. There's some things to polish at the moment.

Using Godot 3.5 LTS. Unity/Monogame versions are being planned.
