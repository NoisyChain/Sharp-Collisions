# Sharp-Collisions
Deterministic collision system written in C#

**Features:**
- 2D/3D collisions and resolution
- Discrete collision detection
- Deterministic behavior using fixed point math
- Broad Phase/Narrow Phase
- AABB collisions
- Sphere/Capsule collisions using distance checks
- Convex polygon collisions using GJK-EPA algorithms
- Collision layers / Ignore collisions
- Triggers
- Rotation support
- Support for multiple colliders
- Collider offset
- Collision flags
- Collision events
- Collision manifolds (return contact normal, depth and contact point)
- A basic character controller for both 2D and 3D

Sharp Collisions is in preview state. There's some things to polish at the moment.

Using Godot 4.4.1 .NET. Unity/Monogame versions are being planned.
